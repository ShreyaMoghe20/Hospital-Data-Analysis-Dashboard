# Hospital-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

### Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of hospital data over four years, from 2018 to 2021, using Power BI for data visualization. The dashboard provides insights into patient demographics, department performance, and trends in patient types. This analysis aims to assist healthcare professionals and administrators in identifying key trends, optimizing patient care, and enhancing operational efficiency.

### Project Objective
The goal of this analysis is to:

- Understand patient demographics and trends across multiple departments.
- Analyze patient types (Inpatient, Outpatient, and Day Patient) to determine patient flow and demand.
- Highlight department-specific performance and identify high-demand specialties.

Data Description
- Time Frame: 2018 - 2021
- Departments Analyzed: 78, including major departments like Orthopedics, Otolaryngology, and Ophthalmology.
- Patient Types:
  - Inpatient: Patients admitted for extended treatment.
  - Outpatient: Patients visiting for consultations only.
  - Day Patient: Patients admitted for less than 24 hours.

### Key Features of the Dashboard
- Patient Type Distribution: Visual breakdown of Inpatients, Outpatients, and Day Patients.
- Total Cases by Age and Time Band: Analysis of patient cases over various time bands, focusing on when follow-ups are most frequent.
- Yearly Comparison (2020 vs 2021): Observations of patient volume changes and trends post-COVID-19.
- Top Performing Departments: Highlights of departments with consistently high patient volumes and performance metrics.

### Insights and Recommendations
- Early Follow-Ups: The majority of follow-ups occur within the 0-3 month time band, suggesting the importance of early consultations.
- Outpatient Dominance: Outpatients form the largest group, which emphasizes the need for efficient outpatient services.
- Critical Department Focus: Specialized departments, such as Pediatric ENT and Haematology, see steady demand, indicating resource allocation priority.
